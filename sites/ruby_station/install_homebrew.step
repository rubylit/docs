tip "Homebrew uses `sudo` to prepare your `/usr/local` directory. 'sudo' stands for 'super user do' and it's a way to get your computer to do anything you ask it to do. It is the subject of a famous cartoon:

![sudo make me a sandwich](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sandwich.png)

$USER is a variable that contains your username. You can also run the command **whoami** in your terminal and it'll output your username."
